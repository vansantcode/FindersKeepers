      <h1>Thank you for choosing Holmes!</h1>

      <p><b>I created Holmes</b> couple years ago <b>for my self</b> bacause I had a problem. <b>I couldn't find correct bookmark</b> from ever growing bookmark archive. Today <b>Holmes is installed over 10 000 times</b>! That's crazy!</p>

      <p>Thanks for using it!<br><i>Jesse / Blackfish</i></p>

        My name is Sherlock Holmes.  It is my business to know what other people don't know.
